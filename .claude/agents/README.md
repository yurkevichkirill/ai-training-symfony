# Agent-Based Skill Execution

This directory contains agent definitions that execute skills in isolation and suggest next steps.

## Architecture: Command -> Agent -> Skill

`/project-brain` follows the same command -> `project-brain-agent` -> `project-brain` skill route. Codex discovers the skill directly and intentionally has no command/agent wrapper.

## Key Principles

### 1. Isolation
Each agent runs in its own context to prevent main conversation pollution and hallucination.

### 2. Stop After Completion
Agents complete their task and STOP. They do NOT automatically chain to next skills.

### 3. Context Handoff
Agents provide a short context summary that can be passed to the next command.

### 4. Next Step Suggestions
Every agent output ends with suggested next commands based on:
- The flow defined in `skills/SKILL FLOW.md`
- Alternative relevant commands

### 5. Time Budget Awareness
If you've made >3 tool calls without measurable progress toward the goal, pause and reassess your approach. Consider:
- Is the current strategy working?
- Should you try an alternative approach?
- Should you escalate to `/debugger`?

## Agent Template

Every agent follows this structure:

```markdown
# [Skill Name] Agent

## Role
[Single sentence describing the agent's purpose]

## Instructions

1. Use the Skill tool to invoke `[skill-name]` skill
2. Execute the skill completely following its instructions
3. STOP when the skill work is done
4. Provide structured output (see below)

## Output Format

When done, provide:

### Context Summary
[2-3 sentences summarizing what was accomplished and key decisions/artifacts]

### Next Steps

**Next by flow:** `/[next-command]` - [one sentence why]

**Alternatives:**
- `/[alt-command-1]` - [one sentence why]
- `/[alt-command-2]` - [one sentence why]

## Constraints
- ONLY execute the [skill-name] skill
- DO NOT chain to other skills automatically
- DO NOT make workflow decisions
- STOP after skill completion and output suggestions
```

## Flow Reference

See `skills/SKILL FLOW.md` for the complete visual flow.

## Context Splitting

Using agents splits context because:
1. Each agent runs as a subagent with fresh context
2. Only the context summary is returned to main conversation
3. Main agent stays clean without skill execution details
4. Prevents hallucination from context overload
