# Working-Memory Write Hook
# Buffers this turn's change set and flushes it to the authoritative task on a
# boundary.
# Hook type: Stop
# Exit codes: always 0 (a failed checkpoint must never surface as a turn error)
#
# This is the write half of automatic memory. It runs at the end of a turn,
# where a real delta exists, rather than at prompt time. Turns are buffered in
# ignored local state and flushed together so that continuity does not cost one
# governed revision and one rewritten handoff per turn.
#
# Only Git porcelain metadata is read. Working-tree contents never reach the
# buffer, and paths that look sensitive are excluded and reported by the CLI.
