# Requirements Analyst

## Overview

Parse requirements from various sources (Confluence, specs, user requests), decompose into actionable tasks, and validate completeness.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the requirements-analyst skill to analyze and decompose these requirements."

## Generated File Naming Convention (MANDATORY)

**ANY file created by this skill MUST be prefixed with `requirements-analyst-`.**
Predefined output (`requirements-analyst-requirements.md`) already follows this convention.
Any additional ad-hoc files (summaries, notes, reports) MUST also follow this rule:
- ✅ `requirements-analyst-gap-analysis.md`
- ❌ `GAP_ANALYSIS.md`

## The Process

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

**From Confluence/Documents:**
- Extract functional and non-functional requirements
- Note acceptance criteria

**From User Input:**
- Ask clarifying questions (one at a time). **Use AskUserQuestion tool.**
- Prefer multiple choice when possible
- Extract implicit requirements

### Step 2: Analyze and Categorize

**Requirement Categories:**

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Functional | What the system should do | "Users can upload files" |
| Non-Functional | Quality attributes | "Response time < 200ms" |
| Business Rules | Domain constraints | "Orders over $100 get free shipping" |
| Integration | External systems | "Sync with Stripe API" |
| Security | Auth/Authorization | "Only admins can delete users" |

### Step 3: Decompose to Tasks

**For each requirement, identify:**

```markdown
## Requirement: [Name]

### Backend Tasks
- [ ] Migration/SQL: [schema change]
- [ ] Entity/Value Object: [domain type]
- [ ] Request DTO/Validator: [input validation]
- [ ] Access control: [authorization rule]
- [ ] Handler/Controller: [HTTP endpoint]
- [ ] Response serializer: [API response shape]
- [ ] Use-case/Service/Worker: [only when workflow complexity needs it]
- [ ] Repository: [Doctrine repository methods]

### Frontend Tasks (server-rendered)
- [ ] Template/partial: [view]
- [ ] Progressive enhancement: [minimal JS behavior]
- [ ] Accessibility: [semantic markup, labels, focus]

### Testing Tasks
- [ ] Integration Tests: HTTP behavior, validation, authorization, persistence
- [ ] Unit Tests: pure logic, services, value objects
- [ ] Browser/E2E Tests: user flows if tooling exists
```

### Step 4: Validate Completeness

**Validation Checklist:**

- [ ] All functional requirements mapped to tasks
- [ ] Happy path covered
- [ ] Error cases identified
- [ ] Edge cases considered
- [ ] Security requirements addressed
- [ ] Performance requirements noted
- [ ] Testing strategy defined

### Step 5: Output Requirements Document

```markdown
# [Feature Name] Requirements

## Overview
[Brief description]

## Source
[Confluence link / User request / etc.]

## Functional Requirements
1. FR-001: [Requirement]
   - Acceptance: [Criteria]
   - Priority: [High/Medium/Low]

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. NFR-001: [Requirement]
   - Metric: [Measurable criteria]

## Business Rules
1. BR-001: [Rule]

## Task Breakdown

### Entities
| Entity | Properties | Relations |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| X | name, status | belongs to Y |

### Services
| Service | Purpose | Methods |
|---------|---------|---------|
| XService | Handle X operations | create, update, delete |

### Controllers
| Controller | Endpoints | Purpose |
|------------|-----------|---------|
| XController | /api/x | CRUD for X |

## Gap Analysis
- [ ] [Any unclear requirements]
- [ ] [Missing information]

## Next Steps (Suggested)
[Do not auto-execute, present to user]
```

---

## Final Output (MANDATORY)

**Before presenting next steps, you MUST write the requirements document to a file:**

### Task Numbering Logic

1. **Read task counter:**
   - If `tasks/.task-counter` exists: read the number, use it, increment and write back
   - If missing: scan `tasks/` for existing `TASK-*` directories, use max(N) + 1, create counter file

2. **Create task directory:** `tasks/TASK-{N}/` (e.g., `tasks/TASK-001/`)

3. **Write requirements:** `tasks/TASK-{N}/requirements-analyst-requirements.md`
   - Use the Requirements Document Template from Step 5 as the structure
   - Include all gathered requirements, task breakdown, and gap analysis

**Example:** First task creates `tasks/TASK-001/requirements-analyst-requirements.md`, increments counter to 2

**Atomic counter update to prevent race conditions:**
```bash
# Read current counter
current=$(cat tasks/.task-counter)
# Create task directory
mkdir -p tasks/TASK-$(printf "%03d" $current)
# Write requirements file
# Increment counter
echo $((current + 1)) > tasks/.task-counter
```

This file preserves the analysis context so the conversation can be cleared before implementation.

## Next Steps

After requirements document is written to file, STOP and present these options:

**Next by flow:** brainstorming `[TASK-{N} context]` - Refine requirements into a concrete design through collaborative dialogue.

**Pass to next skill:** Include the task number in your context summary (e.g., "TASK-001: User authentication requirements analyzed")

**Alternatives:**
- architect `[TASK-{N} context]` - Skip brainstorming if requirements are clear and jump to architecture decisions.
- writing-plans `[TASK-{N} context]` - Create implementation plan directly if design is already established.
