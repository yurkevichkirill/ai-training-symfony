# Browser Verify

## Overview

Verify the user-facing behavior of a running Symfony application. Browser verification supplements tests; it does not replace PHPUnit/Pest coverage.

## Before Starting

Identify how the app runs:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
composer dev
make dev
<frontend-dev-command>
```

Use the project's documented command. Do not invent a dev server setup if none exists.

## Verification Checklist

- Page loads without server errors (check the PHP error log) or browser console errors.
- Authenticated and unauthenticated states behave correctly.
- Forms show server-side validation errors and preserve prior input.
- CSRF-protected forms reject missing/invalid tokens.
- Authorization failures are handled gracefully.
- Success states and redirects are correct.
- Loading, empty, and error states are visible where relevant.
- Keyboard navigation and focus states work.
- Responsive layouts work at mobile and desktop widths.
- The page still works with JavaScript disabled (progressive enhancement baseline).

## Payload Bounds (MANDATORY)

Browser tooling returns the heaviest payloads in this workflow: one full-page
accessibility snapshot or screenshot can cost more context than every other
step of the verification combined, and it is carried for the rest of the
session. Stay inside these bounds regardless of which browser tool is wired:

- Prefer a targeted read - one element, one selector, the page title, the
  form error - over a full-page snapshot. Take a full snapshot only when a
  targeted read cannot answer the question.
- At most three screenshots per verification, each scoped to the element or
  viewport under test rather than the full page, unless layout itself is what
  is being verified.
- Filter console and network reads to errors and the request under test;
  never dump the whole log or the whole request list.
- Never paste a raw snapshot, DOM dump, or screenshot payload into the
  report, the handoff, or a Brain record: cite the URL, the element, and the
  observed behavior instead.
- Close the tab or session once the checklist is done, so no page state is
  carried into the next turn.

When a bound would prevent answering the question, say so in the report
rather than silently exceeding it.

## Evidence

Capture:

- URL verified.
- User role/state used.
- Main interactions performed.
- Screenshots or concise visual notes.
- Any console/network/server-log errors observed.

## Blockers

Stop and report if blocked by:

- Login credentials.
- Manual MFA/passkey/captcha.
- Missing seed data.
- Broken dev server.
- Destructive confirmation.

## Final Output

Return verified flows, evidence, blockers or risks, Context Summary, and next step.
