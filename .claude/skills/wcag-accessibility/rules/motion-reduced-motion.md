## Respect prefers-reduced-motion

**Impact: MEDIUM**

Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` to disable or reduce animations. WCAG 2.3.3.

**Incorrect: animations always play**

```css
.card { transition: transform 0.3s ease; }
.panel { animation: slide-in 0.5s ease-out; }
```

**Correct: reduced motion respected**

```css
.card { transition: transform 0.3s ease; }
.panel { animation: slide-in 0.5s ease-out; }

@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .card { transition: none; }
  .panel { animation: none; }
}
```

Prefer CSS media queries for this rule so the behavior works regardless of any JavaScript layer.
