# WCAG Accessibility Guidelines

Practical accessibility guidance for Twig templates and general HTML interfaces. These rules are based on WCAG 2.2 Level AA and should be used during frontend design, implementation, and review.

## How To Use

- Start with semantic HTML before adding ARIA.
- Prefer native controls: `button`, `a`, `label`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`, `table`, `dialog`, and landmark elements.
- In PHP templates, ensure the rendered HTML is accessible, not just the template source.
- Whatever the Symfony rendering approach (Twig, Forms, UX, Stimulus/Turbo, or progressive enhancement), apply the same rendered-HTML rules.
- Validate forms on the server and expose errors accessibly in the UI.

- `rules/aria-live-regions.md`
- `rules/aria-prefer-semantic.md`

### Color, Media, Motion, Responsive

## Review Checklist

- Labels are associated with inputs using `for` and `id`, or wrapping labels.
- Server-side validation errors are visible and connected with `aria-describedby`.
- Buttons and links use semantic elements.
- Dynamic updates announce important changes with live regions.
- Modals trap focus and restore focus when closed.
- Color is not the only way information is communicated.
- Motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Touch targets are large enough on mobile.
