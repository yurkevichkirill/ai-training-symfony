# WCAG Accessibility Guidelines

Practical accessibility rules for code review and implementation, based on WCAG 2.2 Level AA. Contains 30 rules across 8 categories, prioritized by impact.

## Scope Boundary

This skill is the authority for **accessibility (a11y)** only. For broader UX/interaction/visual review that is not accessibility-specific, use `web-design-guidelines`.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:
- Reviewing frontend code (Twig templates, HTML, CSS, or progressive-enhancement JavaScript)
- Writing new UI components
- Auditing existing interfaces for accessibility
- Checking WCAG AA compliance
- Fixing accessibility issues reported by automated tools or users

## Navigation

Accessibility starts with the foundation: [[moc-semantic]] ensures correct HTML semantics that screen readers depend on, and [[moc-keyboard]] guarantees all functionality works without a mouse — both CRITICAL impact.

When native HTML isn't sufficient, [[moc-aria]] bridges the gap with ARIA attributes, while [[moc-color]] ensures visual information is perceivable regardless of vision ability.

Interactive elements require proper [[moc-forms]] labeling and error handling. Non-text content needs alternatives per [[moc-media]], and motion/animation must respect user preferences per [[moc-motion]].

Finally, [[moc-responsive]] covers zoom, reflow, and touch target requirements.
