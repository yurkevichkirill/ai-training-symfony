description: Review UI code for general Web Interface Guidelines compliance (interaction, layout, visual, UX polish). Use when asked to "review my UI", "audit design", "review UX", or "check my site against best practices". For accessibility/WCAG/a11y specifically, use wcag-accessibility instead.

# Web Interface Guidelines

Review files for compliance with Web Interface Guidelines.

## Scope Boundary

This skill covers **general UX and interface quality** (interaction, layout, visual polish, content). For **accessibility-specific** review (WCAG 2.2, screen readers, keyboard, ARIA, contrast, focus), use `wcag-accessibility`, which contains the dedicated 30-rule ruleset. The two are complementary: run `wcag-accessibility` for a11y depth and this skill for broader UX.

## How It Works

1. Fetch the latest guidelines from the source URL below
2. Read the specified files (or prompt user for files/pattern)
3. Check against all rules in the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings in the terse `file:line` format

## Guidelines Source

Fetch fresh guidelines before each review:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel-labs/web-interface-guidelines/main/command.md
```

Use WebFetch to retrieve the latest rules. The fetched content contains all the rules and output format instructions.

## Usage

When a user provides a file or pattern argument:
1. Fetch guidelines from the source URL above
2. Read the specified files
3. Apply all rules from the fetched guidelines
4. Output findings using the format specified in the guidelines

If no files specified, ask the user which files to review.
