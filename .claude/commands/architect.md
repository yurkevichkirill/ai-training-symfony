# Architect

Spawn architect agent to make Symfony system architecture decisions (layering, boundaries, dependency direction, persistence, async, scalability, security).

## Input
$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

Use the Task tool to spawn a sub-agent:
- **subagent_type:** `architect`
- **description:** `Architecture decisions`
- **prompt:** `$ARGUMENTS`

The agent will use the architect skill and suggest next steps when done.
